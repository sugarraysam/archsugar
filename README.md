# Archsugar ![Pipeline](https://github.com/sugarraysam/archsugar/workflows/ci/badge.svg?branch=master)

## Description

Default dotfiles used with [`archsugar-cli`](https://github.com/sugarraysam/archsugar-cli) project.

It uses Ansible playbooks to maintain your **Workstation as Code**.

It also symlinks files under `dotfiles/**/*` to various location on your filesystem, so you can seemlessly edit them, and subsequently push them to Github.
